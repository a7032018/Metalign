# Metalign: Efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling via containment min hash

Metalign is a method for estimating the taxonomic composition and relative abundances of organisms in a metagenomic sample based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing reads. 

For instructions on usage, please see the wiki: https://github.com/nlapier2/Metalign/wiki
