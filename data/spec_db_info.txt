This is a specification for the db_info.txt file, which supplies the information necessary for MiCoP2 to build the final abundance profile from the raw alignment results. It may be of interest to users to know how this file is formatted, in case they are interested in building their own db_info.txt file for a custom database.


There is one header line consisting of the tab-deliminted column titles: "Accession", "Length", "TaxID", "Lineage", and "TaxID_Lineage". These explain the information contained in the columns below; each column below consists of 5 tab-delimited fields correpsonding to these header fields. However, they are just for human readability and are not factored into the analysis, so they can be renamed to more informative titles.


For instance, the first field, "Accession", refers to an NCBI RefSeq Accession number. Each line in the db_info file corresponds to a unique accession number in RefSeq, which in turn corresponds to a single FASTA header name. When the aligner marks a read as aligning to a certain FASTA entry, the accession field is used to match that entry to other information, specified in the other fields. A user building a new db_info.txt file for their own database would simply write one line per FASTA entry. Note that the accession value should only correspond to the portion of the FASTA line after the initial ">" and before any whitespace; for instance the FASTA header
">NZ_LMVM01000001.1 Methanobacterium bryantii strain M.o.H. contig_1, whole genome shotgun sequence"
is simply represented as NZ_LMVM01000001.1 in the first column. 


The second column, "Length" refers to the length of the FASTA entry, whether it be a complete genome, contig, or something else. This field must be kept consistent, because it is necessary for the profiler to properly normalize abundances based on genome length.


The third column, "TaxID", refers to the NCBI TaXID. Obviously, it is specific to NCBI. This number is used to group all accessions from the same clade into a single identifier. For instance, accessions NZ_LMVM01000001.1 and NZ_LMVM01000002.1 are contigs from the same strain, and are thus grouped into the same TaxID. Similarly, there are TaxIDs for higher clades such as genus, family, etc. all the way up to Superkingdom. MiCoP doesn't care what text you put in this field (so long as there are no tabs or newlines), but it should correspond to the lineage information in the fifth column (see next paragraph).


The full lineage of an accession is specified in terms of taxonomic names in the fouth column, "Lineage", and in terms of the TaxIDs in the fifth column, "TaxID Lineage". MiCoP2 doesn't care about the text that you enter for these fields, but it does care that the fourth and fifth column contain 7 pipes each (this character: "|") separating 8 different strings which may be empty (in case there is no taxonomic classification at that level, as is often the case with viruses). There must be no tabs in any column.


If you wish to adhere to CAMI format, which MiCoP2 does and we strongly recommend, you must also follow these instructions (https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/contest_information/blob/master/file_formats/CAMI_TP_specification.mkd). Most notably, for strain level annotation, the last TaxID lineage should be appended with ".1", ".2", etc for each strain from the species TaxID above. For instance, a species with the TaxID 5232 may contain two strains in your database, which would lead to your TaxID lineages ending with "5232|5232.1" and "5232|5232.2".


So, the information entered in the columns is pretty format-agnositc, barring tabs and newlines, but if you want the final output to make sense, the fields should roughly consist of a FASTA identifier for the entry, FASTA entry sequence length, clade identifier for the FASTA entry, name lineage of the FASTA entry, and clade identifier lineage of the FASTA entry. There should be one header line and these five tab-separated columns per line.


Following these specifications should lead to successful profiling in the standard CAMI format.
